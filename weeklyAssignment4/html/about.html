                <p>
                    The Issue - “Last Mile” distribution networks in emerging markets are 
                    highly inefficient, significantly increasing the cost of living for billions 
                    of people in these markets. For the last 20 years, the leading global companies 
                    have invested billions in trying to solve the Last Mile challenge. But failed.

                    N-Frnds - the First to Succeed - The N-Frnds unique “Last Mile” hybrid, multi-product 
                    distribution network for emerging markets, connects consumer goods brands, insurers and 
                    financial institutions with small retailers and consumers unlocking growth. Our Hybrid 
                    platform combines technology with the traditional distribution network. We set up and 
                    manage the physical network of sales agents (Pre-Sellers) who work with our efficient 
                    network of selected wholesalers. We provide the digital solution to all participants 
                    in the network (e.g. wholesalers, retailers). Global scale - Over 20M users on the 
                    platform (mobile, web, USSD), a proven business model, 21 patents, successful live 
                    networks in South East Asia and Africa.

                    Coca Cola - Strategic Global Anchor Customer – Signed Long Term Agreement - Coca Cola 
                    was impressed at the significant growth and impact on their revenues from joining the 
                    N-Frnds network, as well as on the quality of the valuable new data and transactions 
                    we generate in a  previously “data-white space” enabling us to create unique loyalty 
                    plans for the Last Mile. As a result, Coca Cola selected N-Frnds and signed a strategic 
                    long-term agreement with us to provide and manage their “last mile” indirect distribution 
                    network in emerging markets (ordering, fulfillment, loyalty and financial services).

                            N-Frnds leverages cutting-edge technology together with an innovative business 
                            model to provide BoP individuals and MSME’s with digital access to information, 
                            financial services and connectivity with other ecosystem players.

                            Many initiatives aimed at driving digital inclusion of the BoP are either unscalable 
                            or only reach users at higher levels of the socio-economic pyramid - those with a 
                            smartphone. The result is that the poorest of the poor, particularly women and rural 
                            users, remain even further behind, widening the digital and gender divide.

                            The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a collection of 17 goals set 
                            by the United Nations that universally apply to all countries. Started in 
                            2015 and continuing for the next fifteen years, countries will mobilize 
                            efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate 
                            change, while ensuring that no one is left behind.
